[{"datasetObjectId":"7","dataObject":{"content":"\"This screen shows me how much I have spent on shared expenses, and how much my dad has spent on shared expenses. It shows who was responsible for paying and who is responsible for repyament, so that I can get a summary of who ultimately owes whom how much. My goal is to track each expense, and who paid, so that at the end of the month, when I factor how much I owe my dad in rent, it also factors how much I have spent in additional expenses, and automatically comes out with the ultimate amount of who owes whom. This is much simpler than keeping it on paper, and much less confusing. Any time I have an expense, I just write who paid, and how much, and what the cost was, and then put in a proportion of how we split the cost, like 50/50. I start out by entering how much in rent I owe my dad, and then just add each expense as it comes up. I can also take a picture of the receipt for verification.\""},"annotations":[{"workerId":"private.us-east-2.9f39b17d366a954c","annotationData":{"content":"{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":32,\"label\":\"UC-User\",\"startOffset\":31},{\"endOffset\":62,\"label\":\"UC-Name\",\"startOffset\":38},{\"endOffset\":190,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":117},{\"endOffset\":256,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":212},{\"endOffset\":290,\"label\":\"UC-Goal\",\"startOffset\":272},{\"endOffset\":444,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":392},{\"endOffset\":638,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":617},{\"endOffset\":730,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":686},{\"endOffset\":790,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":759},{\"endOffset\":903,\"label\":\"UC-step\",\"startOffset\":846},{\"endOffset\":304,\"label\":\"UC-DataPractice\",\"startOffset\":296},{\"endOffset\":516,\"label\":\"UC-DataPractice\",\"startOffset\":502}]}}"}}]}]
