If you tap the three dots you can go to edit or remove so if you find that the card did not work maybe you input something wrong and need to edit it or you have hit the limit or need to remove an older card you can easily do that also. It is a well designed screen and it is easy to find to as it is at the bottom and right in front of you.",
